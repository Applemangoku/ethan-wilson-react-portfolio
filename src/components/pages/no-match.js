            <h1>Error</h1> 
            <h2>that is an invalid page try again you stupid flesh bag. You should at least make sure uor link is correct before you press enter. Use a little bit of common sense next time and mabye you will get to the lace you want to go. If you can't spell correctly you shouldn't be on my site. If you ever come back here again I will release my taser drones on you. They will desend from above, crackling with power. They will also be exicuiped with a pistol to shoot. I will use my drones to steal your babys, the train your babys to hunt you down. I will make a sercreat army out of your babys. My drones will train the babys. The babys will be experts in stealth and masters of most forms of hand to hand combat. Anyone who says that taser drones are morraly unethical are idiots. It would be awsome to see a drone flying through the air will a taser, then watch it desend down and imobilise a criminal. Poeple who say that geneticaly modified super humans are unethical are also lacking in brain cells. When humanity starts traveling though space, not every habitabl planet will have a gravity comparable to that of earths. Also, with our current understanding of astrophysics, space travel will take long periods of time. We need te genetically modify people to live indefinetly, and have stronger bones and muscles. Their bones and muscles also need to functionally never deteriorate. That way, they can be born on Mars, then Visit Earth withought needing to train their body to withstand gravitational forces three times grater than they are used to. I don't get why people are so invested in solar, wind, and other "renewable energys." They are horribly ineficent, and they contain many heavy elements. You can't easily recycle solar panels, and their is no way to recycle the wind turbine blads. They just fill up landfills, and polute the local environment. They best way to deal with climate change would be to go nuclear, and create a zero carbon emmison replacement for gasoline. I will heanceforth refer to said replacement as biolean. Biolean would be alot better that making electric cars, because making batteries is so expenstive, and requires the use of heavy elements. Also, the biolean would work with all current gasoline powered motors and generators. That way we don't need to compleatly change the foundations of modern transportation. Nuclear power is much better that solar and wind because it is more reliable, and uses less space. to make solar and wind farms, people need to clear massive amounts of land and disturb the local ecosystems. Animals need to be relcated or kill. Solar and wind farms kill endangered species of bird. Nuclear is very enrgy dense, and all of the radioative waste for 50 years of running a power plant can fit in a single (medium to medium large) room. You should look up more stuff about why Nuclear is better from other sources. Don't just take my word for it. I am hungry. I really like sour patch kids.  they taste pretty good. I want to see how many sour patch kids I can eat in one minute. I would like to say at least 300 grams. I don't know how feasible that is. I don't like how chewy sour patch kids get when you shove more than 6ish in you mouth at once. It tastes good, but it gets stuck in your mouth. There haev been alot of spiders in my room recently. I hate spiders. I wish they woulld stay out of my house. I once almost ate a dead spider that had died in my cocoa puffs. That was a terible experiance. </h2>
